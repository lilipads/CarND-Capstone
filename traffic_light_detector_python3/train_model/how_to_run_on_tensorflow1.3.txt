0. download and configure tensorflow object detection API. 

$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models
$ cd models
$ git checkout 59f7e80ac8ad5491366

Note it is important to checkout the earlier commit as the latest version is not compatible with with the export script.

Follow directions at https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md

1. train and evaluate model on latest tensorflow (>=1.8)

note: 
-some models have errors in training
-latest models have ops that are not in tf 1.4 or 1.3 

2. export inference graph with tensorflow 1.4

note: 
- changing tf.keras.Model -> tf.keras.models.Model for the error

3. run frozen graph on tensorflow 1.3
